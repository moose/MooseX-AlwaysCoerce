=head1 NAME

MooseX::AlwaysCoerce - Automatically enable coercions for Moose attributes

=head1 VERSION

version 0.22

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyClass;

    use Moose;
    use MooseX::AlwaysCoerce;
    use MyTypeLib 'SomeType';

    has foo => (is => 'rw', isa => SomeType); # coerce => 1 automatically added

    # same, MooseX::ClassAttribute is automatically applied
    class_has bar => (is => 'rw', isa => SomeType);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Have you ever spent an hour or more trying to figure out "Hey, why did my
coercion not run?" only to find out that you forgot C<< coerce => 1 >> ?

Just load this module in your L<Moose> class and C<< coerce => 1 >> will be
enabled for every attribute and class attribute automatically.

Use C<< coerce => 0 >> to disable a coercion explicitly.
